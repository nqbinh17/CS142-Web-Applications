This will fetch JSHint into the node_modules subdirectory. You will be able to run it on all the JavaScript files in project2 directory by running the command:
npm run jshint
To run the assignment open the file cs142-test-project2.html in your browser. The web page will load the JavaScript and run a few tests. Since Node.js also contains a JavaScript virtual machine you can also run the tests without a browser using the command:
npm test
